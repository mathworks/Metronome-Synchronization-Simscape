# **Metronome Synchronization in Simscape&trade;**
Copyright 2022 The MathWorks, Inc.

This example models metronomes on a moving platform.  They start out of phase, 
but as the platform moves, they synchronize.  This is an example of a system
that follows the Kuramoto model.

Open the project file Metronome_Synchronization.prj to get started.
